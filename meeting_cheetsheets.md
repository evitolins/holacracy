Tactical Meetings
--------------------------------------------

1. __Check-in Round__ - Notice what's got your attention, call it out.
"Call out distractions, get present, here and now. No cross-talk."
2. __Checklist Review__ - Bring transparency to recurring actions.
Facilitator reads checklist of recurring actions; participants respond "check" or "no-check" to each for the preceding period (e.g. prior week).
3. __Metrics Review__ - Build a picture of current reality.
Each role assigned a metric reports on it briefly, highlighting the latest data.
4. __Project Updates__ - Report updates on key projects of the circle.
The Facilitator reads each project and asks: "Any updates?" The project owner either responds "no updates" or shares what's changed since the last meeting. Questions allowed, but no discussion.
5. __Triage Issues__ - Triage all agenda items in the allotted time.
Build an agenda of tensions to process; one or two words per item, no discussion
To Process Each Agenda Item:
    1. Facilitator asks: "What do you need?"
    2. Agenda item owner engages others as-needed
    3. Capture any next-actions or projects requested & accepted
    4. Facilitator asks: "Did you get what you need?"
6. __Closing Round__ - Harvest learning from the meeting.
Each person can share a closing reflection about the meeting; no discussion.
